Open the folder in VS Code.

Run index.html directly in any browser.

No dependencies. No server. No setup.

⚙️ How Comments & Feedback Work

Comment forms use JavaScript to save data into browser storage:

localStorage → comments_post1
localStorage → comments_post2
localStorage → feedback_list


Data remains saved even after you refresh the page.

Data resets only if:

Browser storage is cleared

You run in incognito mode

This makes it perfect for:

School projects

Mini web development demos

Blog prototypes
